Rails Katas
===========

The Ruby Katas is my journey to enlightenment in order to master Ruby
on Rails. The goal is to learn the Ruby on Rails framework, tools,
techniques, patterns and anti-patterns. We also practice some
culture. Testing is essential in the quest to learn and do great
things in the language.


The Structure
-------------

The katas are independent projects that I perform one or more times. Each kata builds up some knowledge of Rails and builds upon itself.

Some katas are original exercises, other are taken from books.
